                            <p>I recommend using Torani brand syrups for their quality. According to Torani's website,
                                they use sucralose and acesulfame potassium (aka Ace-K) to add sweetness to their
                                sugar-free syrups. You can order directly from their website <a

                            <h3>Can I use different types of milk?</h3>
                            <p>Absolutely! While the website caters to specific preferences, you are welcome to use your
                                preferred milk. For non-dairy options, there are five popular choices: coconut milk,
                                almond milk, oat milk, soy milk, and pistachio milk. Each brings a unique flavor and
                                texture to your coffee.</p>

                            <h3>How many pumps of syrup should we use for different cup sizes?</h3>
                            <p>For a 12oz cup, I recommend using no more than 3 pumps of syrup. For a 16oz cup, use up
                                to 4 pumps, and for larger cups, around 26-30oz, use no more than 7 pumps. Adjusting the
                                number of pumps helps maintain the perfect balance of sweetness and flavor.</p>

                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <h3>Should we use the same number of pumps for both hot and cold drinks?</h3>
                            <p>Itâ€™s best to use one less pump for hot drinks compared to cold drinks. The heat can
                                intensify the sweetness, so reducing the syrup helps maintain the desired flavor
                                profile. For cold drinks, you can use the regular amount of syrup as mentioned above.

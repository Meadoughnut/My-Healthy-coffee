            <div class="question">
                <h3>Where can I get the syrups?</h3>
                <p>I recommend using Torani brand syrups for their quality. According to Torani's website, they use sucralose and acesulfame potassium (aka Ace-K) to add sweetness to their sugar-free syrups. You can order directly from their website https://shop.torani.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-ai0BhDPARIsAB6hmP4GKYbEsmEkrWw48OLf9hbfv-f33RuMnm0Qyl0711VEQOnXlfks8a0aAtuTEALw_wcB or from https://www.amazon.com </p>

                <h3>Can I use different types of milk?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! While the website caters to specific preferences, you are welcome to use your preferred milk. For non-dairy options, there are five popular choices: coconut milk, almond milk, oat milk, soy milk, and pistachio milk. Each brings a unique flavor and texture to your coffee</p>

                <h3>How many pumps of syrup should we use for different cup sizes?</h3>
                <p>For a 12oz cup, I recommend using no more than 3 pumps of syrup. For a 16oz cup, use up to 4 pumps, and for larger cups, around 26-30oz, use no more than 7 pumps. Adjusting the number of pumps helps maintain the perfect balance of sweetness and flavor.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>Should we use the same number of pumps for both hot and cold drinks?</h3>
                <p>Itâ€™s best to use one less pump for hot drinks compared to cold drinks. The heat can intensify the sweetness, so reducing the syrup helps maintain the desired flavor profile. For cold drinks, you can use the regular amount of syrup as mentioned above.</p>
